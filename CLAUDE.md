# Claude Agent Guide

Please use the sectioned documentation under `docs/` as the source of truth.

- Start here: `docs/README.md` (index)
- Key sections: `docs/overview.md`, `docs/non-goals.md`, `docs/architecture.md`
- **CRITICAL: Read `docs/coding-standards.md` - ALL comments and documentation MUST be in English**

Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and keep changes minimal and focused.
